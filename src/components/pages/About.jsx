            I grew up in Los Angeles, California being influenced by the culture and eclectic environment around me. My work is my best way to interpret the ideas I have about myself and the world I live in. Iâ€™m not a talker but I am a visual communicator by trade. My work is an extension of me, my likes, my dislikes, my past and my future. I do not limit myself to one medium, style or concept. I go with whatever feels right in the moment although digital art and screen printing have become my favorite ways to express myself. Donuts quickly became the focus of my work early on because it is something fascinating about them. Not only the taste but aesthetically they make me happy. I have explored other concepts as an artist but I still keep them hanging around in my work because it still feels true to me. If a viewer stops for just a second to reflect upon something I created, I feel I have succeeded in my intentions.
